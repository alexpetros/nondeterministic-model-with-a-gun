# Non-deterministic Model With A Gun (JavaScript Version)

A staged human-computer interaction about the power we give to our tools. Built with ChatGPT (for
now) and [Whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp).

This is the full version that we are going to instantiate inside a remote control robot, and it is
currently incomplete. The complete JavaScript demo presented at WordHack can be found in the
[js-demo](js-demo) directory.

Currently MacOS Apple Silicon only.

## Installation
* `cargo run` to run it
* `cargo build` to build it
* `cargo build -r` to build it in release mode

Right now it just transcribes your audio.
